# DMS-Graph
The discrete Mumford-Shah formalism has been introduced for the image  denoising problem, allowing to capture both smooth behavior inside an  object and sharp transitions on the boundary. In the present work, we  propose first to extend this formalism to graphs and to the problem of  mixing matrix estimation. New algorithmic schemes with convergence  guarantees relying on proximal alternating minimization strategies are  derived and their efficiency (good estimation and robustness to  initialization) are evaluated on simulated data, in the context of vote  transfer matrix estimation.
